Calculate sin(x); x is a radian value. The formula is as under:
sin    =    −
  
3
3!
+
  
5

−
  
7

(hint: degrees can be converted into radians by 3.14159 / 180.)

import math

x = float(input("Enter x in degrees: "))
x = x * (math.pi / 180) 

sin_x = 0
terms = 10 
for n in range(terms):
    term = ((-1) ** n) * (x ** (2 * n + 1)) / math.factorial(2 * n + 1)
    sin_x += term

print(f"sin({x}) ≈ {sin_x}")
