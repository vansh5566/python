Generate 20 random integers and store them in a list. Accept a number from the user and print 
position of all occurrences of that number in the list

import random

numbers = [random.randint(1, 50) for _ in range(20)]
print("Generated list:", numbers)

search_num = int(input("Enter a number to search: "))

positions = [i for i, num in enumerate(numbers) if num == search_num]

if positions:
    print(f"Occurrences of {search_num} found at positions:", positions)
else:
    print(f"{search_num} not found in the list.")
