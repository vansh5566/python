Suppose a date is represented as a tuple (d, m, y). Create two date tuples and find the number of days between the two dates


from datetime import date

date1 = (10, 2, 2024)  
date2 = (25, 3, 2024)  

d1 = date(date1[2], date1[1], date1[0])
d2 = date(date2[2], date2[1], date2[0])

days_diff = abs((d2 - d1).days)
print(f"Number of days between {date1} and {date2}: {days_diff}")
