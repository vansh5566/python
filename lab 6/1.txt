A list contains names of boys and girls as its elements. Boysâ€™ names are stored as tuples. Write a program to find out number of boys and girls in the list. (Hint: use isinstance(ele,tuple))

names = ["Alice", ("Bob",), "Emma", ("John",), "Olivia", ("Mike",), "Sophia"]

boys_count = sum(1 for name in names if isinstance(name, tuple))
girls_count = len(names) - boys_count

print(f"Number of boys: {boys_count}")
print(f"Number of girls: {girls_count}")
