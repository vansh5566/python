What will be the output of the following code?

1) lst = [ (‘X’, ‘Y’, ‘Z’), 40, 50 , 60]

a = lst[0]

print (a)

a) X b) 0 c) (x, y, z) d) (‘x’, ‘y’, ‘z’)



The list `lst = [('X', 'Y', 'Z'), 40, 50, 60]` contains a tuple as the first element. When we do `a = lst[0]`, we are assigning the entire first element, which is the tuple `('X', 'Y', 'Z')`, to `a`.

Thus, the output of `print(a)` will be:

**d) ('X', 'Y', 'Z')**
